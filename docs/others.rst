Sound notifications
-------------------
Starting in version 0.8.5, Picasso supports sound notifications. In Render and SPINNA, these can be selected in the ``File`` menu in the menu bar. The available files are read from the ``picasso/gui/notification_sounds`` folder. ``.mp3`` and ``.wav`` files are supported. Default sound notification is saved automatically when manually changed.

Custom notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add custom notification sounds, copy the sound files (``.mp3`` or ``.wav``) to the  ``picasso/gui/notification_sounds`` folder. Depending on how you installed Picasso, this folder can be found in different locations:

GitHub
------
If you cloned the GitHub repository, you can add sound notifications by following these steps:

- Find the directory where you cloned the GitHub repository with Picasso.
- Go to ``picasso/gui/notification_sounds``.
- Copy the sound files to this folder.

PyPI
----
If you installed Picasso using ``pip install picassosr``, you can add sound notifications by following these steps:

- Activate your conda environment where ``picassosr`` is installed by typing ``conda activate YOUR_ENVIRONMENT``.
- To find the location of the package, type ``pip show picassosr`` and look for the line starting with ``Location:``.
- Navigate to this location and go to ``picasso/gui/notification_sounds``.
- Copy the sound files to this folder.


One click installer (Windows)
-----------------------------
If you installed Picasso using the one click installer from `the Picasso release page <https://github.com/jungmannlab/picasso/releases/>`__ , you can add sound notifications by following these steps:

- Find the location where you installed Picasso. By default, it is ``C:/Picasso``. *Before version 0.8.3, the default location was* ``C:/Program Files/Picasso``.
- Go to the following subfolder: ``picasso/gui/notification_sounds``.
- Copy the sound files to this folder.


One click installer (macOS)
---------------------------
If you installed Picasso using the one click installer from `the Picasso release page <https://github.com/jungmannlab/picasso/releases/>`__ , you can add sound notifications by following these steps:

- Navigate to your Applications folder and right-click on the picasso app, then select "Show Package Contents".
- Add your sound files to ``Contents/Frameworks/picasso/gui/notification_sounds``.


.. _user-settings-file:

User settings file
------------------
Picasso keeps its user settings in ``~/.picasso/settings.yaml`` (``C:\Users\<you>\.picasso\settings.yaml`` on Windows): the last directory used, the Render colormap, the Localize parameters, the CPU and GPU budgets of rendering, the sound notification, and so on. Each module owns a section of the file (``Render``, ``Localize``, ...). The file can be edited with any text editor or via ``File > Picasso settings`` in any module, and changes apply the next time the setting is read - for most settings immediately, without restarting Picasso.

A setting that is missing from the file is written into it with its default the first time it is needed, so every setting a module uses is visible and editable in the file; ``Picasso: Render``, for example, writes all of its ``Render`` keys when it starts. Optional keys that are off unless present (such as ``Render: max_workers``) are the exception.

Every module loads the file, changes its own keys and writes the whole file back, so the file is guarded against mistakes:

- before it is rewritten, the previous version is kept as ``settings.yaml.bak``, so the last good version is always at hand;
- a file that cannot be parsed (a stray tab or a misplaced colon is enough) is never overwritten silently: a copy is kept as ``settings.yaml.broken``, a warning goes to the :ref:`error log <error-log>` and default settings are used - ``Picasso: Render`` also tells you so when it starts. To get your settings back, fix the YAML in the kept copy and paste it into ``File > Picasso settings``, which validates the YAML before saving.

.. _error-log:

Error log
---------
Every uncaught error is appended to ``~/.picasso/logs/picasso.log`` (i.e. ``C:\Users\<you>\.picasso\logs\picasso.log`` on Windows), together with the tracebacks of failing background threads. The file rotates to ``picasso.log.1`` once it exceeds 5 MB.

This matters most for the one-click installers: their GUIs are started from a windowed executable with no console attached, so anything the program prints has nowhere to go. Picasso therefore redirects its output to that log file. When an error occurs, Picasso shows it in a message box (click *Show Details...* for the full traceback) and writes the same traceback to the log.

When reporting a problem on `GitHub <https://github.com/jungmannlab/picasso/issues>`__, please attach the log file - it contains the traceback of the failure.
